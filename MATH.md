# Textile Engineering Formulas

# Yarn Linear Density (Tex)
Tex = pi * (d_mm / 20)^2 * density_g/cm^3 * 10^6

- d_mm = diameter mm
- Real yarns: ~78% packing density

# Fabric GSM (g/m^2)
GSM = (warp_tex * ends/in + weft_tex * picks/in) * 0.254

- 0.254 = inch-to-cm factor
# Cover Factor (%)
Cover = min( (warp_dia * ends + weft_dia * picks)/2 * 100, 110 )
